   <p>During her lifetime, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a US Supreme Court justice, has suffered from three different types of cancer and has most recently been diagnosed with lung cancer in November.

	   <b>Chrome and Google hope to stop hijackers</b>

   <p>To get people to read and click on adds, some website owners have hacked their pages on Chrome so that the user cannot exit out of them (or go back to their original page). One idea that Chrome has to prevent this is to flag sites that you haven't particularly entered into the search bar or, based on your interests, don't align with. Although there are no guarantees that this will be in the new update, it is clear that Google is also trying to combat the back button hijacking. Lately, Google has already taken some steps to block sites that are deceitful and fraudulent.</p>

	<b>DOW falls by 500</b>
