"<span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">&nbsp;During her lifetime, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a US Supreme Court justice, has suffered from three different types of cancer and has most recently been diagnosed with lung cancer in November. However, after a successful surgery, Ginsburg still stood strong. She cast the last vote and terminated the decision that Trump should be allowed to prevent people from seeking asylum in the US if they entered the country illegally. Yesterday, on Christmas, she was released from Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital and is now recovering quickly.</span></span><div><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><br></span></span></div><div><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">~&nbsp;</span></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">December 26, 2018</span></div>","RBG Recovering From Hospital","Supreme Court justices","The Daily Kaylee","http://thedailykaylee.github.io/natnews12.html","2018-12-31T18:53:12.901Z","rbg-recovering-from-hospital"
"<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">&nbsp; &nbsp;To get people to read and click on adds, some website owners have hacked their pages on Chrome so that the user cannot exit out of them (or go back to their original page). One idea that Chrome has to prevent this is to flag sites that you haven't particularly entered into the search bar or, based on your interests, don't align with. Although there are no guarantees that this will be in the new update, it is clear that Google is also trying to combat the back button hijacking. Lately, Google has already taken some steps to block sites that are deceitful and fraudulent.</span></p>

"<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">The DOW&nbsp;Jones Industrial Average fell by 500 points. Some companies that were affected were Amazon, Twitter, and Goldman Sachs. Additionally, the UnitedHealth Group was greatly impacted after Obamacare was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge. Since the Great Depression, this has been the all-time low in the stock market during December. Many people hope that the Fed will lower its sporadic rise in interest rates to reassure and soothe markets and buyers.</span></p>

"<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">On Tuesday, November 13, approximately four hundred migrants who had split apart from the main caravan arrived at Tijuana, the border between California and Mexico. However, instead of welcoming the migrants, the US military is installing barricades and barbed wire so they cannot pass through. Around 7000 troops are stationed at the borders, including in San Ysidro and Otay Mesa. The US Customs and Border Protection has supported this action. To make it even more difficult for the people seeking asylum, Trump approved a decree in which a migrant's acceptance in the US could be postponed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Things are looking dismal for the migrants traveling in the caravan. Many are from Honduras, a country that is known for violence and corruption in its government. One LGBTQ woman from Honduras said she would never want to go back there because she could be killed for being different.</span></p><hr contenteditable=""false""><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">~ November 13, 2018</span></p>","At California Border in Tijuana, Military puts up Barricades","immigration","The Daily Kaylee","http://thedailykaylee.github.io/natnews12.html","2018-12-31T18:18:53.278Z","at-california-border-in-tijuana-military-puts-up-barricades"
"<p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Deborah Cantwell, a 63-year-old woman from Indiana, left a threatening note containing racial slurs aimed toward a neighboring black family's son who had just moved in. She stated that Greentown, where they lived, was an ""all-white neighborhood"" and having African Americans moving in brought back bad memories of blacks beating her sister. She also wrapped the house that they moved into with toilet paper. Once the police arrested her, she refused to apologize and said that she was trying to ""vent"".&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">&nbsp; &nbsp;These kinds of actions are truly unacceptable and there need to be more things to be done to prevent them.&nbsp;</span></p>

"<p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">&nbsp; &nbsp;Recently, many stocks have decreased in value, but the tech industry especially has taken a plunge. &nbsp;The DJIA (or Dow Jones Industrial Average) has already sunk 831 points and the most promising and prosperous companies such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet seem to have suffered the greatest. The U.S. trade war/dispute with China impacts the stocks even more because China usually provides a lot of the materials that the tech companies used. The quote below shows that since China is putting tariffs on the US, people are worried that their company won't profit as much. <em>""</em><em>Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell, said investors fear that rising interest rates and growing expenses are going to erode the boost company profits have gotten from the GOP tax overhaul.""</em> (PBS.org) Will the stocks continue to plummet? Will the US bargain with China concerning the trade deals? Many people wonder if the US economy (though it's doing well now) will be on its way to decline.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Source:</span></p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 2em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration-line: inherit; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">
