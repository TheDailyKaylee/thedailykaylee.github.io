 <h1>Success... and a villager</h1>
  <p>The hunter nods, rolling his eyes. "People are so forgetful these days." Then he mounts his horse again and trots off in a different direction. You breathe a sigh of relief. </p>
  
  <p> You walk off down the street, careful not too look too anxious to get away. Next stop: the Bolted Crag close to the wharf. You check your map again and look around, feeling overwhelmed. Directions and geography have not always been your strong point. </p> 
  
  <p> "You look lost!" You look up in surprise to find an old woman staring right at you. You smile nervously. </p>
  
  <p> "It's okay; I have a map." </p>
  
  <p> "Are you sure? I could give you directions, you poor little thing. Do come inside!" </p>
