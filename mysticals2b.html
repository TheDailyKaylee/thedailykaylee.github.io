  <h1> Shamed </h1> 
  
<p> The Drawa hunter looks at you queerly. "You must be a newbie. Commoners aren't afraid of Drawa hunters." You shiver. Then he smiles. "Oh, I know now! You're one of those children volunteers for the MCRC. They hire them when they're so small. I'll take pity on you and send you back to where you came from. They should know that Lyddia is a greater match for all of us." He blows a whistle and a few other hunters on horseback come. </p>
  
  <p> "Take this toddler close to the Headquarters," he instructs. </p>
  
  <p> "Yessir." You look down in disappointment, knowing that you would be "relieved of service" from the MCRC. Another term for fired. </p>
