  <b><p> Welcome to Mysticals! </p></b>
  
  <p> In this role play game, the adventure calls for you (a member of the Mythical Creature Rescue Committee) to go to the coast of Lyrae. The creatures there (mostly dragons and unicorns) are threatened by the famous sorceress, Lyddia and need to evacuate before she tries to manipulate their powers... Can you convince them to leave their homeland before the sorceress brings all to ruin? *Checks watch.* I have to go on a mission to OCOA, sorry. I'm counting on you! </p>
