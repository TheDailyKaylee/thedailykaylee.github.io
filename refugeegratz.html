Book Review: Refugee
By Alan Gratz

Refugee by Alan Gratz is a must-read. The story follows three refugee children: Josef, Isabel, and Mahmoud from three different time periods. Josef lived in Nazi Germany during the 1930s, Isabel in Havana, Cuba in 1994, and Mahmoud in Syria during 2015. Despite the fact that they lived in different historical periods, the author reveals their shared struggles and triumphs that will give you chills.

Josef, Isabel, and Mahmoud go through many traumatizing experiences in their journeys and yet they are easily relatable to the average reader. They deeply care for their family's safety and want them to stay together. The thought of leaving their homelands is devastating but they would do anything to keep their loved ones alive. Isabel gives away her most prized possessions to prevent her father from leaving Cuba alone and devises a plan that would keep her family together. 
Due to the circumstances, the refugee children have to grow up fast. For example, when Josef's dad becomes unstable after being tortured in the Nazi internment camps, Josef steps in and takes on the role of an adult. Each main character shows wisdom and courage in order to protect their families. Traits like these make the characters so much more lovable. The reader can't help but deeply care for them. It is humbling to think that situations like these are actually happening in the world right now. The book, Refugee, puts you in the shoes of these children which gives you perspective on what it is like to dangerously flee your homeland and seek asylum. 
Besides the inspiring characters and perspectives, each chapter is written with a suspenseful plot twist that leaves you with a cliffhanger. Whether a family is at a gunpoint, a mob storms Cuba, or the Nazis invade, there is enough action to keep you at the edge of your seat!
