	<h1> Chancellor of Germany Losing in Elections </h1> 

	<p>Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, is losing in the recent elections. This is mainly due to her immigration policy of allowing refugees/immigrants to enter Germany, because many people don't agree that the government should let in so many refugees. A lot of conservatives (in the Christian Social Union) who voted for Merkel are now turning against her and joining other parties. This has not happened in many years. To win, Merkel must form an alliance with another party! Most likely, the top two parties now are the first-place Alternative for Germany (conservative) party and the second-place Green Party. People in the Alternative for Germany or AfD are saying, "Merkel must go". </p>
