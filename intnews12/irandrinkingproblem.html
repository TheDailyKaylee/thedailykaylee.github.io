    <h1> Iran tries to deal with its drinking problem </h1> 
	<p>Alcohol has been illegal in Iran for nearly 40 years, since 1979. However, up to 10 percent of the people or more in Iran are addicted to alcohol and may buy/smuggle it through the black market. Recently, forty-two people have died due to alcohol poisoning in Iran, and hundreds of people have been sent to the hospital. This is a lot more than the average amount of deaths related to drinking alcohol beverages, so some people speculate that a certain chemical or type of potent alcohol (such as methanol) have contaminated the drinks.</p>

   <p>The good thing is that, unlike some other governments, Iran is trying to combat its drinking problem. They have opened wards where alcoholics could get the treatment and recovery they need and fight against addiction. The police are now being given breathalyzers to test how much alcohol is in the patient's blood and if they need treatment or not. And lastly, the government is running campaigns to spread awareness about the dangers of alcohol. This is especially important for the young people in Iran, so that they don't grow up to become addicted.</p>

  <p>Even with the controversy going on in Iran nowadays, I believe that they have taken a small step forward by trying to battle alocohol addiction. Hopefully, these campaigns will save many young and innocent lives. </p>
