<p>Jefferson's Sons is one of the best historical fiction stories I have ever read! Read this book not only for its historical accuracy but also for its ethics about slavery, lovable characters, and entertaining plotline.</p>

<p>The reader follows the story of Beverly, Maddy, and Eston Hemings, the secret slave sons of President Thomas Jefferson. They live at Monticello, Jefferson's slave plantation, and are gradually exposed more and more to the cruelties of slave life when some of their friends and neighbors are sold or beaten. They have it better than most, but the sons are left to contemplate when they realize that there are certain unexplainable, unfair privileges that only some people can get. This book shows what it is like to have your well-known father also be your slave owner. </p>

<p>The story begins by shadowing Beverly, the oldest son. He loves Master Jefferson and wants to be closer to him. "Why can't we be a family?" he asks his mother. Eventually, he sees Jefferson and his father gives him a kit violin. He enjoys playing the violin, but more than that he wants to have his father back. The reader is heartbroken every time Jefferson chooses to play with his white grandchildren instead of bonding with Beverly, who's around a similar age. Eventually, Beverly gives up trying to "connect" with his father and goes back to normal life. </p>

<p>The next son, Maddy, has light brown skin-- the darkest out of all of his mother's children. He realizes that he will never pass as white once Jefferson sets his slave children free (like he promised to do so) and hates Master Jefferson for not caring about him. However, he is very studious and was secretly taught to read and write by one of Master Jefferson's grandchildren. My favorite story in Maddy's section was when he and his best friend, James, caught a wild mockingbird for Master Jefferson because his own mockingbird had died of old age. He gave it to Master Jefferson, who was very pleased and paid him and his friend. Then, the bird let out a mournful squack and Maddy felt terrible. "He, Maddy, had sold that bird into slavery." (pg. 144) What was meant to be a happy visit turned melancholy.</p> 

<p>At the end of the book, the author shares what is believed to have happened to these characters once they grew up. I won't spoil that part for you! Once I finished this book, I was amazed at how it left me feeling both sad yet inspired. The simple descriptions were astounding. </p>

<p>All in all, this book is of very high quality. I highly recommend it for readers of all ages! </p>
