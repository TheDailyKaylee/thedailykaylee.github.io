<p>The March series by John Lewis, one of the most influential figures in the 1960 Civil Rights Movement, made me realize how powerful non-fiction graphic novels can be. In this trilogy, John Lewis focuses on his early-life to the height of the Civil Rights Movement through stimulating graphics, dialogues, and overviews. </p>
	<p>The book covers many experiences in John Lewis's life, occasionally intersected with present-day ones. In the beginning, we learn about his childhood growing up on the farm and fascination with chickens. As an African-American, John Lewis experienced the unfairness of racism and segregation ever since he was young, making him want to assure that all people, no matter their race, had equal rights. The struggle to achieve this, however, was tremendous. Many men, women, and children died despite protesting peacefully. Often times, the government and police department did nothing to remedy this. Corrupt officials continued to beat, abuse, and jail innocents. It seemed that the fight for voting rights and equality would never end.</p> 
	<p>Besides the historical content itself, March provides an insight into what it is like to be an African American activist during the 1960s. I was swept along with the characters participating in the various marches to demand civil rights. I would feel hopeless when yet another child was murdered and triumphant when I saw various people from all over the U.S. unify and bond together to sing during the march. Conflicts and risks were high but worth it in the end. If you're a fan of history and graphic novels, the March series will be a page-turner. 	</p>
