<p>Do you want to read a book that's both thought-provoking and vivid? A book that has mind-boggling stories that you can't put down? If so, Einstein's Dreams is the perfect novel for you! This fictional book focuses on what life would be like if a certain aspect about time was changed. For example, one chapter focuses on a world where time moved slower in high elevations and another focuses on a world in which people only live for one year. Every world usually has a disturbing, comical, or ironical twist that makes it so enjoyable to read.</p>

<p>Each chapter represents a different world or a part in Einstein's life. Though the book doesn't have much of a plot (there are more little individual plots), it's still captivating. Once I finished this novel, I was so inspired by the beautiful writing style and complex ideas I decided to write my own story in a similar manner!</p> 

<p>In conclusion, this book will leave you to feel invigorated and enlightened. It's one of those books where if you read it over and over again, you'll still get more meaning out of it.</p>
