            <p class="subtitle">May 6, 2017</p>
            <p>I sit at the kitchen countertop, my laptop open but undisturbed in front of me, the white emptiness overwhelming, yet strangely underwhelming at the same time.</p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#050617" aria-expanded="false" id="050617-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="050617" class="collapse">
              <p>I move my hands so that my fingers hover over the keyboard and begin haphazardly tapping keys, as though the labeled black squares were piano keys capable of making music, hard enough to produce slight clicking noises but soft enough that the page in front of me remains, quite stubbornly, blank.</p>
              <p>I do not know what to write about.</p>
              <p>It’s a rather common problem, and one that I have grown accustomed to after years of churning out essays and hours deliberating in front of bright white Word documents; indeed, it is one that I have almost come to expect as a writer and a columnist. Yet, today is different. Whereas I usually have some sort of idea — that isn’t to say it’s a good idea, or even a mediocre idea; in fact, it is often an objectively bad idea — today, I have absolutely nothing.</p>
              <p>I stare at the faint reflection of myself in the whiteness of the document before me, the nearby furniture shadows on my laptop screen. I toggle with the brightness of my laptop screen, trying to convince myself that once I have managed to get rid of my reflection and other similarly distracting visuals, I will be able to begin writing.</p>
              <p>A smile flits across my face as I consider the irony of having an utterly wordless Word document, but quickly disappears into a pensive frown as I notice the old clock hanging on the textured kitchen walls, the beige paint that makes up a sizable chunk of our house’s surface area closer to a soft yellow when illuminated in the rays of afternoon sun that sneak in from between the heavy slats of the half-open window blinds behind me.</p>
              <p>I fiddle absentmindedly with the spoon in my half-eaten (and half-forgotten) vanilla yogurt, studying my distorted reflection in the smooth curvature of silver, before turning my attention to the yogurt itself, counting the gray-black flecks of ground vanilla bean that dot the creamy white surface. My laptop screen is whiter than my yogurt. I decide that the best way to remedy this problem is not to begin writing, but rather, to finish my yogurt — vanilla bean specks and all — and thus set myself to the task, prolonging the inevitable by ignoring the page in front of me.</p>
              <p>But after finishing my yogurt, I realize that save for filling up my stomach with creamy vanilla bean-dotted yogurt, I have not accomplished anything in the past half hour. I still have no idea what to write about and time has not been particularly kind; the formerly yellow-hued walls are now indisputably beige, evidence of a sinking sun and rapidly approaching deadline.</p>
              <p>Yet, as I toss my empty yogurt cup in the trash and wash the spoon out in the sink, I realize that I do have something to write about — everyone does, given enough patience and thoughtful dilly-dallying. And yes, this column about finding something to write about is exactly what I chose to write about.</p>

            <p class="lead">Home Away from Home</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Feb. 11, 2017</p>
            <p>I was 10 minutes in, and already, the doubt had crept in. As two not-quite-but-almost screaming fifth-grade boys settled in behind me, I wondered if I had made a mistake in signing up to be an Outdoor Education cabin leader. </p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#021117" aria-expanded="false" id="021117-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="021117" class="collapse">
              <p>But even as I wondered, the giant yellow school bus pulled away from the curb, filled with the chatter of overly excited — and secretly nervous — fifth-graders. This was it. There was no backing out now. I had traded high school students for fifth-grade students and long, warm showers for short, freezing ones. I was switching from sitting all day to hiking through the redwoods, from walking in the rain to squelching in the mud (albeit still in the rain). I had swapped frequent screen time for no service and midnight homework sessions for lights-out at 9:30 p.m.</p>
              <p>However, the bus ride over — uneventful save for a rather messy car sickness episode a few rows in front of me — soon helped me conclude that despite the astonishing propensity of fifth-graders to talk (very loudly), I had made no mistake when signing up to be a cabin leader. </p>
              <p>The week flew by, and somehow, I found that things, both big and small, had changed. Any hint of awkward unfamiliarity between the girls in my cabin and me had disappeared. Laughing, listening to their complaints, discussing the best part of breakfast, reading them bedtime stories and even gently reprimanding them, I felt, more than anything, as though I were a big sister to the 16 lively girls I was tasked with keeping track of.</p>
              <p>The numbing cold and squelching mud had become constants, pushed to the background in the face of breathtaking views and towering redwood trees. The electronics hiatus didn’t bother me; I could still take out my phone from time to time to take photos, and there was hardly any urgent matter to attend to. And the chilly showers worked well with the time constraints — in fact, I highly doubt that I would have gotten out of the stall quickly enough if the water had been any warmer.</p>
              <p>And so as the week drew to a close, I found — to my slight surprise — that a small part of me was not yet ready to go home. Sure, a long, steamy shower would be more than appreciated and it would be nice to check in online to see what I had happened in my absence (after all, Donald Trump had just been inaugurated three days before we left for Outdoor Education, so there was bound to be some newsworthy topic upon my return). But I had grown fond of the crisp, cold air, the nonsensically funny conversations, the puddles and my mud-caked boots, the endless supply of hot chocolate, the majestic redwood trees and ocean waves — even the abundance of enormous yellow banana slugs would be missed (though perhaps not as much).</p>
              <p>So, as I settled once more into my seat on the bus, heading the opposite direction this time, I tried my best not to doze off and instead struck up a conversation with a little boy, valiantly trying to hide his tears, who was sitting beside me. And in the midst of our trivia games and laughter, as he dried his eyes for the last time, I took a moment to unlock my phone and check my calendar — to see when the next week of Outdoor Ed was going to take place, of course.</p>

            <p class="lead">Senior Crunch</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Sept. 23, 2016</p>
            <p>Junior year of high school is supposed to be the hard one: you’re supposed to take “challenging” courses and get good grades in all of them, take the PSAT or SAT or ACT or any combination of two or all three (at least once if not twice), take some arbitrary amount of SAT Subject Tests and Advanced Placement exams and participate fully in a few extracurricular activities.</p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#092316" aria-expanded="false" id="092316-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="092316" class="collapse"><br>
              <p>And so when junior year finally ended, I thought the worst was over. After all, I finished all of my required standardized testing in junior year and chose to take fewer AP classes this year. But for me, it is senior year, and not junior year, that appears to be the most difficult stretch of high school.</p><br>
              <p>The first semester of senior year, from the time school starts in mid-August to just before winter break ends in early January, is college applications season. Head into the San Mateo High School library during study hall periods and you’ll locate, quite easily, the huddled groups of seniors, their fingers tap-tap-tapping away on laptops, pausing only to think and stare off into space, first trying to figure out what makes them the best fit for a certain college, then struggling to put those feathery light, abstract ideas into cohesive words and sentences.</p><br>
              <p>We type out tentative thoughts and suggestions onto blank white Word documents, but delete our musings as quickly as they come, one finger always hovering over the backspace key. By now, most of us high school seniors are done with standardized testing, and at this point, whatever extracurricular activities you did in high school are pretty much set. So all that’s really left is the essay. Or perhaps more accurately would be essays plural, since essays tend to come in pairs and triplets and quadruples at the peak of college application season.</p><br>
              <p>But essays are no easy feats. What is a 17-year-old supposed to say when you ask him what he wants to do in the future? What should a high school senior say when you ask her what makes her special and the best fit for a certain school? And most importantly, how do you take 16, 17 or even 18 years of your life and compress that into an essay of 650 or fewer words?</p><br>
              <p>There is no good answer&#8202;—&#8202;because it really isn’t possible. You simply cannot take someone’s life, thoughts, personality, ideas and dreams and fit it into one essay, much less an essay of only 650 words. And while that truth can be disconcerting at times, especially given the supposed importance of the essay in college admissions, I sometimes view the impossibility of the matter as a good sign, a comforting one.</p><br>
              <p>After all, while it may make this semester one of the most stressful that I’ve ever experienced&#8202;—&#8202;as I cycle through idea after idea, draft after draft, in hopes of writing an essay that at least captures some aspects of me as a person&#8202;—&#8202;I at least know that my 17 years of life are too broad, too deep, too complex to be flattened into an essay not much longer than this column. And thus, in the midst of college application season when, ironically enough, seniors tend to lose parts of themselves in an attempt to find and write about themselves, I take solace&#8202;—&#8202;and pride&#8202;—&#8202;in knowing that I and all of the things I’ve done and learned cannot fit into 650 words because, after all, it is not the college that I end up attending, but rather myself, that defines who I am.</p>

            <p class="lead">Break from the Grind</p>
            <p class="subtitle">April 22, 2016</p>
            <p>I didn’t realize what I had been missing until just last weekend, which flew by all too quickly on the sunny streets of Los Angeles. Although I was in L.A., along with more than 10 other students from San Mateo High School, for a national high school journalism and yearbook convention, the most important takeaways from that weekend have nothing to do with journalism.</p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#042216" aria-expanded="false" id="042216-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="042216" class="collapse"><br>
              <p>That’s not to say I didn’t learn anything from the convention workshops and seminars, because I definitely did. From learning how to use Adobe InDesign more efficiently to getting professional feedback on our newspaper’s layout schematics, the time spent indoors with the thousands of other high school journalists was truly well spent. But it was the time spent outdoors&#8202;—&#8202;with a small group of friends walking on the beach at sunset or eating lunch outside under the sun&#8202;—&#8202;that was the most memorable.</p><br>
              <p>As a junior, much of my life takes place inside the classrooms and hallways that make up my high school. As a general rule of thumb, I’m inside from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays, maybe outside for half an hour eating lunch every few days or so. And life outside of school, which somehow still manages to revolve around school, is a semi-chaotic mess of homework and essays, of worksheets and tests, which takes place almost exclusively under the roof of my home.</p><br>
              <p>There are always 10 different things that I could be doing at any given moment, and the hectic schedule of school and extracurricular activities I maintain ensures I have little, if any, free time on most days. And at some point&#8202;—&#8202;maybe it was at the start of junior year, maybe it was at the end of sophomore year, or maybe it wasn’t really a point at all but rather a smooth progression that began when I first stepped onto campus as a freshman&#8202;—&#8202;I became buried inside, under mountains of binder paper and bland pages of textbooks.</p><br>
              <p>I expected life in Los Angeles to be nearly the same as it was at home: a day inside a makeshift classroom learning new things followed by hours of scribbling and homework, which I was, unfortunately, not exempt from, despite being physically removed from the confines of San Mateo. But, surprisingly, my French notebook stayed undisturbed in my suitcase for the entire duration of the trip and my biotech essay was still naught but a blank Word document when I came back home on Saturday night.</p><br>
              <p>While in L.A., instead of spending the final hours of daylight and the not-yet frigid hours of night cooped up indoors, I went outside to soak up the sun and gain a few extra sun freckles. Instead of stressing over an endless stream of schoolwork, I went outside to walk with the sand between my toes and the ocean by my side. Instead of hunching over my laptop under bright fluorescent lights, I went outside to wander through the streets and marvel at the city.</p><br>
              <p>It was a jolting reminder of what life used to be like before I forgot how to take my time and enjoy the world around me, a Polaroid from a time when I spent every spare minute running on asphalt, tumbling through leaves and gazing at stars. I didn’t realize that these moments had disappeared&#8202;—&#8202;and I didn’t realize how much I had missed them&#8202;—&#8202;until my weekend in Los Angeles came to an end. But if I learned anything last weekend, it’s that it is never too late. And so, even as finals approach and school comes to a close, I expect to see new sun freckles from the San Mateo sunshine joining the ones that mark my time under the Los Angeles rays.</p>

            <p class="lead">My Time to Drive</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Jan. 29, 2016</p>
            <p>The day before school started this semester was a Tuesday. To be exact, it was Tuesday, Jan. 5, 2016. It was raining furiously at 8:45 a.m., but an hour later, the clouds had been pushed to the perimeter, where they hovered and threatened the peaceful blue patches of sky. It may seem strange to remember such frivolous details from a random date that passed nearly a month ago, but that was the day I got my license.</p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#012916" aria-expanded="false" id="012916-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="012916" class="collapse"><br>
              <p>The night before, I had found myself incapable of sleeping for what seemed like an eon, waiting wide-eyed on the bed&#8202;—&#8202;a mixture of anticipation and fear&#8202;—&#8202;for the night to pass. I had received my permit nine months ago, back in April, and had finally decided in December that it was time for me to get my license.</p><br>
              <p>But I still had no idea what to expect when I arrived at the DMV office in pouring rain at 8:30 a.m., 15 minutes before my test. The pounding of water droplets on the roof of the car only served to make me more and more nervous, especially as I recalled that failing to use the windshield wipers properly was one of the few critical driving errors, errors that can be summed up as “Sorry, try again in another two weeks.”</p><br>
              <p>As I waited for my turn to drive, the rain gradually slowed to a gentle trickle, and by 9:45 a.m., as I reached the front of the line, the only signs of rain were fat globules of water that sat silently on the street below and the green leaves above. Although the extended wait had done nothing for my nerves, I was secretly grateful the windshield wipers would not be a pressing concern during my driving test.</p><br>
              <p>When the DMV driving test examiner entered the car, suited in a long, blue all-weather coat embellished with the DMV logo, I felt as if I was bound to crash into the curb or forget my hand signals or run a red light. In short, I was almost confident I was going to make a mistake. But miraculously, I managed to return back to the DMV without having scratched the car, or having posed a hazard to any poor passerby that had happened to cross paths with a nervous teenager in charge of a car, or having bumped into anything either living or nonliving. I had passed.</p><br>
              <p>The first emotions that swept me were all somewhat related to exhilaration, and although it wasn’t really the case, I felt as if I had more freedom than before. I was finally able to drive on my own, my two hands on the wheel, the passenger seat beside me empty. But after the initial delight and rush of excitement faded, I soon realized the true implications of receiving my license.</p><br>
              <p>Having my driver’s license meant that there were people out there&#8202;—&#8202;my family, my friends, the DMV and the general public&#8202;—&#8202;who trusted me. People who trusted me and my abilities enough to allow me to control a 3,500-pound lump of leather, rubber and painted metal. People who trusted me to pay attention to my surroundings at every single moment while driving and people who trusted me to obey the traffic signs and signals. People who trusted me to follow the provisional license restrictions and say no when asked to give my friends rides.</p><br>
              <p>My driver’s license is a privilege, but one that comes with the greatest possible responsibility&#8202;—&#8202;that of ensuring the safety of myself, but mostly, the safety and lives of those around me. And believe me, if I am on the road, know that I am doing my best.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Nov. 21, 2015</p>
            <p>I found out about the Paris attacks Friday afternoon, shortly after school had ended. Tired from a long day that started at 6 a.m., I was half asleep when I walked into the room where my school’s Model United Nations club regularly meets. There was a Model U.N. conference at Stanford that weekend, and we were planning on driving down straight from school.</p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#112115" aria-expanded="false" id="112115-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="112115" class="collapse"><br>
              <p>But after changing into the requisite formal attire, I was jolted awake by breaking news from a fellow club member: Paris was under attack by terrorists&#8202;—&#8202;over 26 had already been killed and nearly 100 were being held hostage. In disbelief, I pulled out my own phone and typed in one word: “Paris.” I watched as the colorful Google logo disappeared, and as the page refreshed, headline after headline covered my entire screen, assuring me that there was no mistake at hand; this was no false alarm.</p><br>
              <p>On the car ride to Stanford, we kept the news on, toggling between stations, listening to horrors not quite a world away. When the reporters began to repeat themselves on the radio, I found myself glued to the feed of live updates from The New York Times, refreshing the website every few minutes to check the hostage situation, and as morbid as it was, to check the steadily rising death toll.</p><br>
              <p>Everything everywhere seemed to be about Paris. During dinner, the TV blared updates on the City of Light, and as police stormed the Bataclan only to find 80 dead bodies, I found that I had lost my appetite. Even the topic for the Model U.N. conference’s opening ceremony had changed to focus on Paris, the Islamic State and the rise of global terrorism. As I walked to my committee room, I passed a group of newscasters taking down a camera set up on the grass in front of a Stanford building; they had just finished interviewing a professor about the terrorist attacks in Paris.</p><br>
              <p>As I logged on to Facebook late Friday night, I was greeted with dozens of notifications. Scrolling through my feed, I saw that countless friends had updated their profile pictures with a filter of the French flag. Underneath each blue, white and red profile picture, Facebook politely suggested that I do the same, “to support France and the people of Paris.”</p><br>
              <p>I had never known it before, but Facebook offers users the option to post a temporary profile picture to support various causes (and apparently different sports teams). As someone who has been studying French for the past four years, and as someone who has seen firsthand the city of Paris, I wanted to demonstrate my own support for France and the Parisians. But after clicking the “Try It” button next to one of the freshly edited photos on my feed, I was met with a dilemma: How long was I supposed to keep my profile picture Paris-themed?</p><br>
              <p>Facebook had taken the liberty of giving me different options: one hour, one day, one week or forever. But even so I was still at a loss. Definitely not one hour, definitely not forever. But one day seemed too short; I did not want my profile picture to change back when the death toll was still climbing. And one week also seemed unsuitable; what sort of support would I be showing if my photo changed back while victims were still being identified and France was still grieving?</p><br>
              <p>I puzzled over the issue for a while, uncertain about the best way to tactfully approach the situation. But in the end, I realized that there was no need to change my profile picture to show my support for France&#8202;—&#8202;doing so was only one method amid countless others.</p>
              <p>I logged out with the same profile picture I had logged in with; everything was the same, but I was more acutely aware of the tragedy in Paris. So to the people of France: although my Facebook photo is not covered with your nation’s blue, white and red stripes, please know that I am still thinking of you.</p>

            <p>Over the past six months, things have changed quite a bit where I live. The grass is browner, the soil is drier and the sound of sprinklers is scarcer. Everywhere I look, I see the signs of California’s multi-year drought. There are the small things: the little signs posted at the local gym asking members to do their parts and conserve water, the once-standard glasses of ice water missing from restaurant tables, the new drought-tolerant plants and landscaping in local parks. And then there is the wilting grass that covers my neighbors’ lawns&#8202;—&#8202;and my own.</p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#092615" aria-expanded="false" id="092615-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="092615" class="collapse"><br>
              <p>At first it was disconcerting to see so much brown. The color that covered the gardens and yards nearby was not simply different&#8202;—&#8202;it was the wrong color. Grass, plants, leaves and lawns were supposed to be green. Not yellow-green, not yellow and definitely not brown. Sure, I knew that we were in a drought and that the governor had ordered mandatory water restrictions. But still, did water conservation have to look so ugly?</p><br>
              <p>I did my best to try and help out with the drought situation, taking shorter and shorter showers, turning off the faucet while brushing my teeth, watering my herbs with the leftover water that was used to wash fruit and vegetables, and soaking the dirty dishes instead of scrubbing them. And as I followed most of the Bay Area Water Supply and Conservation Agency’s essential water-saving tips, I slowly developed an appreciation for the small water conservation measures that added up to huge savings.</p><br>
              <p>Turning the faucet off while brushing my teeth? The equivalent of saving two gallons of water every minute. Cutting my shower time in half? Twenty-five gallons of water saved every night. Cutting the shower time in half again? Another 12.5 gallons of water for each shower. It was exhilarating to be able to count and calculate the amount of water that I could save all on my own. To think that I alone was cutting my water usage by almost 40 gallons of water a day made me realize that perhaps the drought was not some distant problem that Central Valley farmers needed to figure out; perhaps, I could help them out&#8202;—&#8202;albeit from 200 miles or so away. It was the power of one at its best.</p><br>
              <p>And as I became drawn into this sort of art and science of saving water, I began to accept that perhaps brown was the new green, that perhaps the color was not quite as ill-suited to front yards as I had originally thought it to be. That perhaps letting the grass run dry was an acceptable way to rack up the number of gallons of water saved. And so I added “not watering the grass (most of the time)” to my ever-growing repertoire of water conservation methods.</p><br>
              <p>Now, whenever I spot a dying, brown patch of grass in someone’s front yard, I no longer think of the lawn as ugly, or woefully neglected. To me, it almost seems to be a badge of honor that proclaims the lawn’s owner as someone who cares about the drought, and someone who is willing to change the way they do things for the good of our community. A lot about water conservation is really just changing the way we look at water and the record-breaking California drought, but sometimes change can be hard to accept and implement. The trick to staying afloat in a sea of change is to start small. So even if you can’t accept (at least not yet) that brown is the new green, you can start by doing the little things&#8202;—&#8202;turning off the faucets, taking shorter showers&#8202;—&#8202;and maybe, just maybe, letting the grass turn brown.</p>

            <p>Last Wednesday, I took the long way home to make a detour to the post office. </p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#031117" aria-expanded="false" id="031117-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="031117" class="collapse">
              <p>It took me more than a moment to figure out how everything was supposed to work — I rarely use so-called "snail mail," and even when I do, I tend to just leave the stamped letter in my mailbox for the mailperson to pick up when they stop by to deliver the mail. </p>
              <p>I passed by the carefully numbered rows of shiny postal boxes, shoes echoing softly on the scuffed, slightly dirty tile floor, and watched as a woman briskly marched to the rows beside me, her steps even and assured, and unlocked her postal box. I couldn't help but marvel at the simplicity of it all as I watched her take out a handful of white envelopes of varying sizes, lock her box and leave, hair billowing slightly in the wind as she opened the door, heels still clacking hollowly on the floor. </p>
              <p>As the door swung shut, I moved forward to join the line of mostly older, well-dressed adults. The only teenager in sight, I couldn't help but feel out of place with my bulky backpack and casual school clothes. But at the same time, I belonged in the post office, with this group of strangers that had almost nothing in common with me — nothing save for the packages and envelopes, gifts and messages, wishes and letters that we were trying to send. </p>
              <p>As I struggled to stuff a scarf — a birthday present for a friend who had just moved to Russia — into one of the sharply creased flat rate envelopes, the woman behind me smiled, her eyes crinkling as she proceeded to show me her similarly stretched flat rate envelope. "Don't worry, it'll fit," she laughed, interrupting the repetitive sounds of footsteps and clicking buttons. "It took me a good few minutes, though."</p>
              <p>She was right. As I sealed the envelope, not without a sense of accomplishment, I absentmindedly wondered what she was mailing. What all of these people were mailing. To who? Where? Why?</p>
              <p>Each of us had taken time out of our day, out of our lives, to come inside this building, walk across this scratched tile and wait in this line patiently, all to do nothing more than mail something off to someone. I studied the woman behind me, her face relaxed and jovial, and wondered if she had grandchildren; maybe she was sending them a gift. I turned back around to look at the man in front of me, his shoulders tensed, his fingers curled tightly around the edges of a thick stack of cream-colored envelopes, all letter-size. He must be mailing something important, I decided; otherwise, he could have just dropped the envelopes off in the boxes outside. Perhaps something business-related that needed tracking or special features. But as I puzzled over his set of letters, he stepped forward and I was first in line.</p>
              <p>And then I was no longer in line.</p>
              <p>I walked up to the open window, customs declaration and slightly misshapen package in hand. The man looked me up and down, the edges of his mouth turning up in what seemed to be amusement, before turning his attention to the package. "Russia? That's pretty far. There's always a story behind the long-distance ones."</p>
              <p>He wasn't wrong, of course. There is a story, of becoming friends with a girl in elementary school and growing older together, even though she lives half a world away now. But he wasn't completely right, either. It's not just the long-distance ones. Each letter that is sent off, each package that is mailed away comes with a story — one that somehow both begins and ends with the post office, but also stretches out far beyond the walls of the post office. And while none of us in the post office is sending the same items, each of us is mailing stories. After all, while people are very different, sometimes we are very much the same.</p>

            <p>Last week, before winter break drew to a close, making way for 7 a.m. alarms and 8 a.m. lectures, I found myself making my way to the living room couch, a steaming cup of tea in one hand, a Margaret Atwood novel in the other. As I settled into the comfortable softness that only old couches have, the rain outside forming a steady, soothing rhythm, I removed the bookmark from where I had left off months — maybe even a year — ago, flipping to the front of the novel to begin anew.</p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#011417" aria-expanded="false" id="011417-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="011417" class="collapse"><br>
              <p>Except for a short break to pour another cup of tea, I read for two or three hours straight, reveling in the sound of falling rain droplets and crinkling pages, enjoying the feel of the sofa's worn leather and the novel's textured paper. Curled on the sofa, eyes following the neatly printed lines of black text, it was a while before I realized that I had accidentally left my phone upstairs while grabbing the throw from off my bed.</p><br>
              <p>I instinctively made a move to stand up, wanting to head upstairs and retrieve my phone. But as I slid the bookmark in between the pages and disentangled myself from the warmth of the blanket, I paused. I had no need for my phone at the moment — there were no urgent emails or last-minute homework assignments. And catching up with friends on Facebook or by text could hardly be considered a now or never activity. Besides, when I had free time, I was online in some format — on my phone, or my laptop, or perhaps even both simultaneously — likely 90 percent of the time.</p><br>
              <p>I sank back into the sofa, rearranging the blanket and taking another sip of my still-warm Earl Gray tea before reaching for the paperback again. Opening to the bookmarked pages, I resumed reading, the plump water droplets still falling in an organized manner, as though there had been no interruption whatsoever.</p><br>
              <p>And it wasn’t until I heard my father’s footsteps, echoing in the corridor by our front door, that I paused to look up at the clock. Surprised, I realized that it was almost six at night. The story was almost over, the blanket no longer staved off the chill completely and the rain that had been so pleasant had disappeared long ago, leaving puddles of water and small piles of fallen, wet leaves in its wake.</p><br>
              <p>Yet, as I stood up to greet my dad, I couldn’t help but smile — doing “nothing” for an entire afternoon had been a lot more fun than I had expected. In between the flurry of extracurricular activities and breakneck pace of high school, I had forgotten just how valuable it is to consciously go offline and make the time to do something completely unrelated to my coursework, clubs or other commitments — something that I had long considered “doing nothing,” a grossly unproductive usage of my time at a period when time is, perhaps more than anything, the commodity highest in demand.</p><br>
              <p>But I’ve realized that maybe, just maybe, I had it wrong in the first place. Perhaps some of the time, unplugging and doing “nothing” is, in fact, the better option.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">May 27, 2016</p>
            <p>By the time winter break ended and this semester started, 50 percent of me was more than ready for summer. And in the months that have passed since then, that percentage has slowly but (very) surely increased. Yet, it didn’t occur to me just how quickly the school year was ending until just last week when I received my yearbook.</p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#052716" aria-expanded="false" id="052716-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="052716" class="collapse"><br>
              <p>The yearbook, with its candid (and sometimes too candid) photos and its carefully (and sometimes hastily) scrawled autographs, is an unmistakable reminder that my time as a junior is rapidly drawing to a close. And at just over four pounds, it’s a rather conspicuous&#8202;—&#8202;and heavy, in more ways than one&#8202;—&#8202;reminder. It’s a bit frightening to see that three years of high school, three years of middle school and five years of elementary school have passed so quickly and perhaps even more frightening to think that in less than a year, for better or for worse, I will be entering adulthood.</p><br>
              <p>School, at least for me, always ends with a mixture of anticipation and trepidation. There’s something joyous about knowing that you won’t have to wake up at 6:20 in the morning five days a week, that you won’t have to spend seven or eight hours of your day sitting behind a desk, that you won’t have to bubble in 60 questions in 60 minutes (using a No. 2 pencil, of course). And while you may argue (and it would be a valid point) that nobody was locked up or really confined during the school year, there is a sort of freedom that goes hand in hand with summer break.</p><br>
              <p>Yet, the end of the school year doesn’t just mean freedom and fun, laughter and good times. It is also not seeing some friends at all for several months, pausing clubs and school-related extracurricular activities and for me, starting college applications. (And there’s plenty of summer homework in case you had nothing planned for the summer!) The start of summer means that yet another year has flown by; it means growing older, taking on more responsibility and saying goodbye to teachers and staff. But most of all, it means bidding graduating seniors farewell and, thus, exchanging yearbooks for what will most likely be the last time.</p><br>
              <p>I’ve only had my yearbook for a week or so, but strangely enough, it seems much longer. Maybe it’s the sheer number of memories living in the yearbook pages, but whatever it is, it makes me feel as if I have been carrying the yearbook around in my faded plaid backpack since the first day of school. And while I’m perfectly aware that the yearbook is nothing more than an inanimate (albeit beautiful) collection of paper&#8202;—&#8202;288 glossy pages bound together&#8202;—&#8202;there’s something so special within those pages.</p><br>
              <p>The students and the teachers, the games and the rallies, the clubs and the classes, the 2015–2016 school year: all of it is captured in the vivid photographs and slightly smeared signatures that crowd the first and last pages of my yearbook.</p><br>
              <p>And it is these colorful, smudged words, words from seniors, friends and teachers, words scribbled in all handwritings, which truly mark the end of my junior year.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">March 25, 2016</p>
            <p>Approximately two weeks ago, I celebrated my 17th birthday. Besides the fact that I now need to write “17” instead of “16” on all of the (very few) official documents that high school students are obliged to sign, I still feel the same.</p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#032516" aria-expanded="false" id="032516-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="032516" class="collapse"><br>
              <p>When I was younger, turning a year older was a big deal. It meant throwing a party, inviting throngs of raucous friends to celebrate, receiving and opening presents and, of course, eating cake and making a wish (or two). Growing older was a sign of maturity, a badge of honor, a symbol of coolness. In a way, to add a digit to your age was to join an exclusive club&#8202;—&#8202;one whose membership was based solely upon the number of years you had been around. And thus, it was only natural to hear kids bragging about their age and how they had just turned 11&#8202;—&#8202;an age of particular importance because two hands were no longer enough to tally the number of years of existence.</p><br>
              <p>The change between each age used to be sudden and distinct, you were 8 one day and then you were 9 the next. You were 9 one day and then you were 10 the next. Each milestone was clearly marked out and even if it was merely a difference of one day, the change was humongous. But now that I am older, the change, if any, is subtle and the occasion less important. After all, the difference between a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old does not arise from some special nirvana reached on the day before turning 17; it is a difference measured in the consequences that come in a package with the number 17.</p><br>
              <p>To be 16 is to be able to legally drive on your own, to be a junior in high school. It meant, at least for me, that I only had two more years left before adulthood and because of that, there would be more responsibilities required of me. And to be 17 is to be nothing less than a year away from being a legal adult, a year away from being able to vote, a year away from graduating high school and a year away from leaving home for college.</p><br>
              <p>By this point, there is less partying (piles of schoolwork and countless standardized tests&#8202;—&#8202;indisputable extensions of being 16 or 17&#8202;—&#8202;see to that), fewer presents (I have most of what I want and practically all that I need, and asking for more seems unnecessary) and less bragging accompanying birthdays. Growing older is no longer a matter of adding to your age and joining some exclusive club; the differences between being 16, 16 1/2 and 17 are nonexistent whereas 9, 9 1/2 and 10 are each miles apart. And visually too, 16 and 17 are nearly indistinguishable whereas 9 and 10 are distinctive ages.</p><br>
              <p>Sure, I am older, even if I don’t look any older. But the fact is that I am growing older every day, and so for me, turning 17 is less about actually being 17. Because the older I’ve become, the more I’ve come to realize that it isn’t so much about the actual age&#8202;—&#8202;the numbers written down on official documents&#8202;—&#8202;but rather about the implications that come with age.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Dec. 25, 2015</p>
            <p>As 2015 comes to a close, I have started&#8202;—&#8202;as I do at the end of every year&#8202;—&#8202;to draft my New Year’s resolutions. But looking back on the New Year’s resolutions that had been carefully memorialized with a festive green pen last December, I half-wonder if the tradition of New Year’s resolutions is one worth keeping.</p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#122515" aria-expanded="false" id="122515-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="122515" class="collapse"><br>
              <p>Of my dozen or so New Year’s resolutions of 2015, I have only managed to accomplish a few. Without getting into the gory details of just exactly how many of my resolutions have been kept, let’s just say that if this was a graded assignment, I would have walked away with a failing grade. And I don’t mean a barely-failing, almost-passing grade. I mean like a flat-out, non-negotiable F.</p><br>
              <p>But at least I am not alone in my (essentially annual) failure to accomplish and stick to all of my New Year’s resolutions. A study done by Scranton University found that only 46 percent of those who made New Year’s resolutions were still on track six months later. And another survey done by FranklinCovey found that by the end of January, 35 percent of people had already broken their New Year’s resolutions. The dismal numbers seem like they would deter anybody from even bothering with New Year’s resolutions, but I have grown quite fond of my possibly-achievable but not-likely-going-to-be-achieved resolutions. Because even when most of my New Year’s resolutions don’t make the full 12 months, I can still take pride knowing that most do make it at least six months&#8202;—&#8202;and all of them manage to survive at least January.</p><br>
              <p>There is just something nice about taking a moment at the end of each year to reflect on all of the events and the memories, all the successes and the failures, that come bundled with every year and every resolution. And after the thoughtful, nostalgic parts of me have finished contemplating the fates of my New Year’s resolutions, I love pausing to think about what I want the next year to be like, even if I know that the resolutions that I swear to stick to will eventually be broken. The whole process of drafting New Year’s resolutions, while it does not necessarily yield the results I may hope for, at least provides me with a sense of what I want to change or improve, and a direction to work toward in reaching my goals.</p><br>
              <p>I have found that whenever I get that I-am-so-bored-because-there-is-absolutely-nothing-to-do-in-this-whole-entire-house feeling, having a list of goals or New Year’s resolutions allows me to channel my energy into something more productive than wandering throughout the house and moping about. So at the very least, I can thank my ambitious list of New Year’s resolutions for preventing any idle, aimless dawdling. And I bet the rest of my family members are grateful for those resolutions as well because, when I am bored, I will admit that I do have the habit of poking my head into other rooms and bothering the rest of the family with small talk when they are trying to get work done (No worries, they pester me just as much, so there are no hard feelings here!).</p><br>
              <p>So despite the rather gloomy prospects of me accomplishing all of my New Year’s resolutions, I have decided to draft another dozen or so New Year’s resolutions for 2016, which certainly promises to be an exciting year what with the elections and the summer Olympics and me entering senior year (You can bet that one of my resolutions is to stay sane in senior year). So, here’s to a happy and healthy New Year, and even if your resolutions don’t quite pan out, take as much comfort as you can in knowing that mine won’t either!</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Oct. 23, 2015</p>
            <p>The decorations started about a week ago. I had been staring outside (the way I always do when riding shotgun) when I came face to face with two friendly-looking scarecrows&#8202;—&#8202;the first of many to come. One slightly larger than the other, they both sported plaid flannels in varying shades of autumn. Behind the two obviously homemade masterpieces, stringy white cobwebs looped wildly around the dark green bushes, paying homage to none other than the last day of October.</p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#102315" aria-expanded="false" id="102315-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="102315" class="collapse"><br>
              <p>Although winter is a close runner-up, fall is&#8202;—&#8202;at least most of the time&#8202;—&#8202;my favorite season (yes, I am one of those pumpkin-obsessed folks). There is just something so fresh and familiar about autumn: the scents of cinnamon and other spices, the annual metamorphosis of the neighborhood trees from green to golden reds, the thrilling chill that arrives with the characteristic fall drizzle. But as cobwebs, ghosts and witches increasingly become the centerpieces of both green and brown front yards, I realize that I have outgrown one of fall’s signature holidays.</p><br>
              <p>When I was younger (back when dressing up as princesses or ladybugs was both commonplace and adorable), Halloween’s chief appeal was staying up later than my usual bedtime. While my friends chased down Snickers, Twix and Jolly Ranchers with impressive gusto, I mostly just tagged along&#8202;—&#8202;although I will admit that I thoroughly enjoyed ringing foreign doorbells (which was always eagerly done with a childish impatience), knocking on the wooden doors of brightly lit houses and shouting out “trick or treat!” in unison with my fellow princesses and witches.</p><br>
              <p>Since I grew up without one of those insatiable sweet tooths that most of my friends were privy to, the candy-fueled excitement of Halloween was never quite there. After returning home with my stash of the season’s cheapest candies, I would dump the colorful assortment out onto the carpet, ready to start what was, to me, the highlight of Halloween. Along with my younger sister (who was often more than happy to eat the Three Musketeers bars I collected), I counted the night’s wages, carefully sorting the candies&#8202;—&#8202;first by brand, then by size and color. The organization of my Halloween treats complete, I was satisfied to let the candies sit on the carpet, where the neatly ordered rainbow sweets proudly boasted of my fantastic sorting abilities. There they would stay until my parents (after stepping on one too many Skittles packs) finally ordered me to clean them up; by then, I was typically ready to move on from Halloween to what I considered the gist of autumn: pumpkin and spice and everything nice.</p><br>
              <p>Now that I am older, the late-night explorations and the mysterious, glowing houses no longer hold the same magical appeal that they did when I was still in elementary school. Although I know plenty of high school students who still cannot relinquish Halloween, I have not been trick or treating in several years now, choosing instead to stay home with a basket of candy, homemade pumpkin pie and some cinnamon-spiced apple cider.</p><br>
              <p>Nowadays, I get to watch the annual celebration from the other side of the coin, as I stay at home passing out Nerds and Hershey bars to the 4 foot tall superheroes, Disney characters and vampires who knock on my front door. Listening to the little kids who can barely speak yell out a garbled variation of “trick or treat” and seeing their vibrant smiles, I know that, as doubtful as the trick-or-treaters may be, it is actually me who has the better end of the deal this time.</p>

            <p class="lead">College at COSMOS</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Aug. 29, 2015</p>
            <p>It has been four weeks since I came back home from my month-long stay at the University of California at Davis, where I spent what was perhaps the best summer of my 16 years. I realize that I have, in a sense, gained a genuine taste for what college has in store for me. When I first landed on the sprawling college campus to attend the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS), I was not sure what to expect&#8202;—&#8202;all I knew for certain was that being away from home for four weeks would test my ability to function independently (and my ability to withstand the unforgiving, 100 degree Central Valley weather).</p>
            <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#082915" aria-expanded="false" id="082915-expand" class="btn btn-default btn-md read-more-buttons">+</button>
            <div id="082915" class="collapse"><br>
              <p>When I first arrived at my dorm, the door was already ajar and the sound of unfamiliar voices floated through the air, assuring me that I was the last person to show up&#8202;—&#8202;exactly what I had hoped would not happen. Luckily for me though, all of my roommates turned out to be welcoming, friendly souls. Over the somehow not long enough four weeks, they became part of my family&#8202;—&#8202;and the last day of camp, where goodbyes were inevitable, was memorialized with our tears.</p><br>
              <p>Over the course of my month at COSMOS, I got the chance to experience the freedom that college life brings. Instead of relying on my parents to drive me here and there, I biked wherever I wanted, whenever I wanted (most of the time at least), and the feeling of being independent was exhilarating in a completely new way. Instead of eating whatever my parents had decided to cook for dinner or whatever was the easiest to whip up for breakfast, I was allowed to choose from a wide array of cuisines at the dining commons, sharing food and laughs with roommates and other friends.</p><br>
              <p>That doesn’t mean that there weren’t any drawbacks to college life though. After all, as the saying goes, with great freedom comes great responsibility. And I will admit that sometimes it was difficult juggling the new responsibilities that living alone brought. I no longer had my parents looking out for me all the time, meaning that it was up to me to make sure that I woke up and got to class on time. Although I was never late to class, there were a few close calls where the snooze button on my alarm was pressed numerous times.</p><br>
              <p>Besides struggling with morning difficulties, living in a dorm required that I did my fair share of the chores&#8202;—&#8202;which I can sometimes get away with at home. At COSMOS, nobody did the laundry for me, meaning that I alone had to carve out the time to do the laundry, preferably before I actually ran out of clothes to wear. Being away from home also meant that I couldn’t escape helping out with vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom and taking out the trash.</p><br>
              <p>And although it was tempting to go shopping downtown or go eat out, living with a budget at COSMOS made me realize that perhaps one of the most overlooked aspects of college is the fact that most students are in debt, meaning that they have to set&#8202;—&#8202;and stick to&#8202;—&#8202;a reasonable budget.</p><br>
              <p>But by the time COSMOS came to a close&#8202;—&#8202;and those four weeks flew by much too quickly, I had already realized that I would miss my college experience much more than I had previously thought possible. After experiencing college life as a high school student (which I definitely recommend trying out), the future seems so much closer and so much more palpable, almost like a surprise present that I have already peeked at waiting for me just around the corner.</p>
