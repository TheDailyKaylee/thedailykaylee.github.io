  <h2>Quest for Wishes (NFMW ISENA)</h2>
    <h3>Welcome to The Quest for Wishes, where your wishes can come true! *Greets you at the door.* Do come inside! My name is Cali, and I'm your guide for today. Have you ever wanted to fly, have alien vision, become invisible, reverse time...etc? Well, in this shop, you can do all of those things! 
Choose a wish from The Gallery or create your own custom wish with The Wisher (The Sorceress). Remember, though, each wish comes with a price, and they can be quite costly! The Wisher will see if she has all the secret ingredients to make the Wish. If she does, you may pay the price. If she doesn't, you will go on a perilous journey to fetch the ingredients and bring it back-- if you do come back. A guide (like me) will guide you on your journey. One more thing-- be careful what you wish for... 
Also, all powers you have before disappear when you go on a Quest. You will be armed with weapons and armor before you embark on your journey. </h3>
