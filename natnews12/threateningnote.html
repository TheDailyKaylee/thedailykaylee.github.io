<h1> Woman Left Threatening Racist Note and said, "I just needed to let off some steam." </h1> 
	<p>Deborah Cantwell, a 63-year-old woman from Indiana, left a threatening note containing racial slurs aimed toward a neighboring black family's son who had just moved in. She stated that Greentown, where they lived, was an "all-white neighborhood" and having African Americans moving in brought back bad memories of blacks beating her sister. She also wrapped the house that they moved into with toilet paper. Once the police arrested her, she refused to apologize and said that she was trying to "vent". </p>

   <p>These kinds of actions are truly unacceptable and there needs to be more things to be done to prevent them. </p>
