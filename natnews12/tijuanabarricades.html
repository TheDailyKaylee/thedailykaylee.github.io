<h1> At California Border in Tijuana, Military Puts up Barricades</h1> 
	
	<p>On Tuesday, November 13, approximately four hundred migrants who had split apart from the main caravan arrived at Tijuana, the border between California and Mexico. However, instead of welcoming the migrants, the US military is installing barricades and barbed wire so they cannot pass through. Around 7000 troops are stationed at the borders, including in San Ysidro and Otay Mesa. The US Customs and Border Protection has supported this action. To make it even more difficult for the people seeking asylum, Trump approved a decree in which a migrant's acceptance in the US could be postponed.</p>

<p>Things are looking dismal for the migrants traveling in the caravan. Many are from Honduras, a country that is known for violence and corruption in its government. One LGBTQ woman from Honduras said she would never want to go back there because she could be killed for being different.</p>
