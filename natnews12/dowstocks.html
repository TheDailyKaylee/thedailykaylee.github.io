<h1>DOW falls by 500</h1>

<p>The DOW Jones Industrial Average fell by 500 points. Some companies that were affected were Amazon, Twitter, and Goldman Sachs. Additionally, the UnitedHealth Group was greatly impacted after Obamacare was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge. Since the Great Depression, this has been the all-time low in the stock market during December. Many people hope that the Fed will lower its sporadic rise in interest rates to reassure and soothe markets and buyers. </p>
