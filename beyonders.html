<h1><center>Beyonders Trilogy Review</center></h1> 

<p>Imagine a world without heroes-- a world where a wicked mage crushes the hopes of anyone who tries to defy him. It is a world of unrest. All of the mage's enemies are dead, in hiding, captured, or are bribed into going to his paradise prison, Harthenham. Some dream of the end of his reign, yet don't know how to even step up to challenge him. The common people have little hope of overthrowing their leader, for he has magic and they do not. This is the fearing world of Lyrian. Yet, Lyrian learns a lesson at the end of this series: you don't have to have magic to be powerful. </p>

<p>In the beginning of the book, we meet Jason and Rachel, two 13-year olds from America, who enter Lyrian through unexpected ways. They are then introduced to each other by Galloran, a rebellious old king who once set off to defeat Maldor, the evil mage. Jason and Rachel desperately want to go home, but Galloran says that the easiest way to access a portal home would be to destroy Maldor and his troops. Reluctantly, they both set off to find the Word, a word that would destroy Maldor if spoken to him. In their journey, they face perilous encounters with the monsters and Maldor's forces, but also make friends along the way. Even with their doubts, each step of their quest makes them more committed and passionate about the cause to defeat the emperor. The books after the Beyonders: A World Without Heroes continue the story-- and yes, the second and third books are just as good (if not better) than the first. You won't be disappointed by the distinct characters and the clever plot twists, which in the end fit together like perfect puzzle pieces. Who will betray and who will remain true to the cause? Will Maldor ever fall?</p> 

<p>In the end, the story wraps up on a melancholy but satisfying note. All of the wit, humor, collaboration, and hope in this book left me temporarily silent in awe after I turned the last page. I thoroughly loved all of the philosophical dilemmas in the book, and almost wept, surprised, at the ending.</p>
