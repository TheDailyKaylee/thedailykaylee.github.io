  <p>I love planetariums. Who doesn't? Their beautiful geometric domes and amazing projections make them the best theatres. My mom and I visited the planetarium at the College of San Mateo. Even though it is not as large as the one in the California Academy of Sciences, I had just as much of a great time. </p>

	<p>In the beginning, Professor Stanford, the host, showed us a video of the night sky projected onto the dome. It felt like we were actually outside, stargazing! Then, he showed us the constellations that were visible within our hemisphere and the peculiar but entertaining stories behind them. I loved looking at the different constellations (some of which didn't look like what they were supposed to be) and learning about how they appear to be "moving" in the sky as the earth rotated. Watching the stars is so mesmerizing. </p>

	<p>Then, we watched a video of our solar system and the universe-- from the Big Bang to our future. The projections were so realistic and breathtaking that we were in awe. We learned about how the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, why some galaxies are redshifted, and the different types of theories about how our universe will end. We were so inspired by the show that we decided to come back the following night for the stargazing event at the Observatory. It was exhilarating to view a close up surface of the moon and the rings of Saturn through the high powered telescopes. </p> 

	<p>If you happen to live close to CSM, or are visiting from out of town, you should definitely stop by and go to these events. The Planetarium show is held every second Friday of the week, and I'll post CSM's website for more information. Also, go to the shows a couple minutes early! The seats fill up quickly and it’s first come, first serve. Did I mention it’s free? The Planetarium and the high powered telescopes from the Observatory won't disappoint.</p>
