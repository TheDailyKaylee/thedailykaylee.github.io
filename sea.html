<p>The Old Man and the Sea, one of Ernest Hemingway's last works, is a suspenseful and heart-wrenching novel. It opens your eyes to the harsh reality of life yet still inspires you to keep going and never give up.</p>
<p>The main character is Santiago, an old Cuban fisherman notorious for his bad luck. He doesn't have many friends but maintains a close relationship with a boy named Manolin. Every day Manolin brings him food and they sit and talk about baseball. Sadly, because Santiago has not caught a fish for 84 days, Manolin's father forbids him to fish with the old man again. But determined to prove his worthiness, Santiago leaves one morning and rows far out in the ocean. Soon, he feels a great tug on his fishing line. Could it be? Sure enough, an approximately 2000 pound or more marlin is caught on the hook. His wishes are granted. However, Santiago and the marlin struggle with each other; the marlin is strong enough to pull Santiago far from home. Days pass, and the villagers begin to worry.</p>
<p>Will the old man survive or fight until the end? Will they both perish from the strain? Hemingway's unique writing style will grab your attention and make you care for Santiago. Read The Old Man and the Sea to discover what happens next. </p>
