	<b> Chancellor of Germany Losing in Elections </b> 

	<p>Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, is losing in the recent elections. This is mainly due to her immigration policy of allowing refugees/immigrants to enter Germany, because many people don't agree that the government should let in so many refugees. A lot of conservatives (in the Christian Social Union) who voted for Merkel are now turning against her and joining other parties. This has not happened in many years. To win, Merkel must form an alliance with another party! Most likely, the top two parties now are the first-place Alternative for Germany (conservative) party and the second-place Green Party. People in the Alternative for Germany or AfD are saying, "Merkel must go". </p>

	<b>Stocks plummet in the tech industry</b>

   <p>Recently, many stocks have decreased in value, but the tech industry especially has taken a plunge.  The DJIA (or Dow Jones Industrial Average) has already sunk 831 points and the most promising and prosperous companies such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet seem to have suffered the greatest. The U.S. trade war/dispute with China impacts the stocks even more because China usually provides a lot of the materials that the tech companies used. The quote below shows that since China is putting tariffs on the US, people are worried that their company won't profit as much. "Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell, said investors fear that rising interest rates and growing expenses are going to erode the boost company profits have gotten from the GOP tax overhaul." (PBS.org) Will the stocks continue to plummet? Will the US bargain with China concerning the trade deals? Many people wonder if the US economy (though it's doing well now) will be on its way to decline.</p>

	<b> Iran tries to deal with its drinking problem </b> 
	<p>Alcohol has been illegal in Iran for nearly 40 years, since 1979. However, up to 10 percent of the people or more in Iran are addicted to alcohol and may buy/smuggle it through the black market. Recently, forty-two people have died due to alcohol poisoning in Iran, and hundreds of people have been sent to the hospital. This is a lot more than the average amount of deaths related to drinking alcohol beverages, so some people speculate that a certain chemical or type of potent alcohol (such as methanol) have contaminated the drinks.</p>

   <p>The good thing is that, unlike some other governments, Iran is trying to combat its drinking problem. They have opened wards where alcoholics could get the treatment and recovery they need and fight against addiction. The police are now being given breathalyzers to test how much alcohol is in the patient's blood and if they need treatment or not. And lastly, the government is running campaigns to spread awareness about the dangers of alcohol. This is especially important for the young people in Iran, so that they don't grow up to become addicted.</p>

  <p>Even with the controversy going on in Iran nowadays, I believe that they have taken a small step forward by trying to battle alocohol addiction. Hopefully, these campaigns will save many young and innocent lives. </p>

	<b>North Korea, Denuclearization </b> 
<p>The U.S. had peace talks with North Korea in hopes of its denuclearization and Kim Jong Un, the president of North Korea, has recently declared that he will shut down one of the country's missile testing sites, Tongchang-ri.</p>

   <p>However, North Korea has different ideas about what denuclearization will look like than the United States. While the U.S. is willing to take back its sanctions in return for North Korea's complete denuclearization, Kim Jong Un said that North Korea will denuclearize if the U.S. will withdraw its troops in South Korea (as well as its sanctions). Additionally, to try to get around the sanctions, North Korea also is illegally trading with other countries (importing oil and fossil fuels). So, how much can we really trust North Korea? </p>

   <p>The U.S. threatens to impose sanctions on any country that is fueling North Korea. '“The United States will not hesitate to impose sanctions on any individual, entity, or vessel supporting North Korea’s illicit activities, regardless of nationality,” Nauert said.' (Theguardian.com) They are particularly warning Russia, who has been trading with North Korea repeatedly throughout the year. There has been 148 known cases of ships going to North Korea and delivering fuel and Russia is a high suspect of sending those vessels. We must prevent this trade from happening or else North Korea will continue to manipulate us and not comply to denuclearization.</p>
