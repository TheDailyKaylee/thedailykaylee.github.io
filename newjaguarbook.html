<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br>

 

<p>I began watching birds when I was very young. By the time I was fifteen I was a very serious and accomplished birder and by the time I was seventeen I knew I would spend the rest of my life working with birds, and I have - sort of. When I first went to the tropics in 1972, it was to work with birds, and birds have been the focus of my fieldwork all over the American tropics. Along the way I encountered plenty of other fascinating and exciting tropical creatures - many species of monkeys, Giant Otters, Giant Anteaters, Brazilian Tapirs, Anacondas, Black Caimans, and many more. While I loved seeing them, none interested me enough to seriously pull my attention away from birds. Then I saw my first Jaguars. Birds are amazing creatures and they will always be a big part of my life, but Jaguars are an order of magnitude more awesome than the most incredible birds I have ever seen.</p>

 

<p>What makes the Jaguar so special to me? To start with, there are all the usual things people mention. It is the largest cat in the Americas and the third largest cat in the world, right after Tiger and Lion. While very similar in many ways to the Leopard of Africa and Asia, the Jaguar is a larger and more powerfully built animal. Unlike the Leopard, which has to contend with the larger Lion and Tiger in its environment, the Jaguar reigns supreme throughout its range. It can also be a very elusive creature, as I can certainly attest to, and, of course, it is an extraordinarily beautiful animal.</p>

 

<p>Beyond those things, however, there is something else more intangible that draws me to Jaguars. Maybe it is the thrill of working with an animal that can eat me. I was charged by a Jaguar in the Pantanal, and it was a thrilling experience, to say the least - one of the highlights of my life, and earning me the nickname isca de onça (Jaguar bait) by the crew of the Piura Miuna, the houseboat where I was based. But my attraction to Jaguars goes beyond fear. I have had the incredible privilege to look deeply into the eyes of many Jaguars at close range. The feeling I get is not one I can easily put into words. It is like nothing I have ever experienced when looking at a bird, any bird. The cold stare they return seems a blend of indifference, mild contempt, curiosity about how I would taste, and calculation about whether or not I am worth their trouble. Among other things, I am an artist, and I used to paint mostly birds. Now I paint mostly Jaguars. They have captured my creative spirit.</p>

 

<p>As a child enthralled with wild animals, the weekly television series Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color, with its regular airing of wildlife documentaries, was a great source of inspiration for me. Even today, after a lifetime of studying wild creatures, when I think of many wild animals, the first image of them to pop into my mind is a clip from a Disney documentary. The documentaries were cutesy and anthropomorphic and of poor quality compared to the spectacular wildlife documentaries we see these days, but for a child getting his first exposure to the animals of far flung lands, they were perfect. I would look forward to the show every Sunday evening in anticipation of some new creature.</p>

 

<p>So it was with the Jaguar, with the first film I ever saw of this magnificent creature coming to me via the Wonderful World of Color’s “Jungle Cat” episode in 1964. (Jungle Cat had originally aired as a feature film in 1959, but I missed that earlier iteration.) Jungle Cat was billed as a documentary about the life of a female Jaguar in the Brazilian rainforest. Looking back on it now, with an intimate knowledge of both Jaguars and the Brazilian rainforest, I realize that most of the footage in the documentary was of a young Jaguar roaming around in a man-made set. Even today, with our considerably more sophisticated techniques in wildlife filmmaking, shooting a free-roaming Jaguar inside the rainforest would be next to impossible. In 1964, however, I didn't question the verity of the documentary, and the Jaguar captured my imagination.</p>

 

<p>Around the same time I got my copy of Mammals - A Guide to Familiar American Species by Herbert Zim and Donald Hoffmeister (1955), a treasured volume in my early library. This little Golden Nature Guide, which still sits on my book shelves, was my first source of scientific information of many North American mammals. As with the Disney documentaries, James Gordon Irving’s beautiful illustrations in this book come immediately to mind when I think of many of the mammals included - Opossum, Abert’s Squirrel, Ring-tailed Cat, Marten, Mink, Wolverine, Mountain Lion - and Jaguar. Unlike the rainforest setting of the star performer in Jungle Cat, Irving depicted his Jaguar crouching atop a rock in the Sonoran Desert, with Saguaro cacti in the background. The small accompanying range map showed the species just barely making it into southern Arizona. Even back then I remember being surprised at the adaptability of a creature that could live in both desert and rainforest.</p>

 

<p>When I made my first trip to South America in 1972 I had high hopes of seeing a Jaguar, but that first trip was to Colombia, as were my second and third trips, and Jaguars had already been eliminated from most of the places I visited.</p>

 

<p>It was June 1976 when I first stepped into the Amazon rainforest of eastern Peru, a region that still had Jaguars. The site was “Panguana”, the former field station of ornithologist Maria Koepcke and zoologist Hans-Wilhem Koepcke, along the Rio Llullapichis in the Department of Huanaco. While I would be living in the forest there for three months to study and paint the birds of the area, I had high hopes of also seeing a Jaguar during my stay. Alas, while I did have a close encounter with a Puma along one of the forest trails just a few days into my stay, the Jaguar eluded me. Bad luck in seeing Jaguars would haunt me for many years to come. It became a mythical beast for me, as it has been for the indigenous human cultures throughout the Central and South American range of the species.</p>

 

<p>The following year, in 1977, I began working as a resident naturalist at the Explorer’s Inn along the Rio Tambopata in Peru’s Department of Madre de Dios. The Explorer’s Inn was the first tourist lodge deep in the Amazon rainforest of southeastern Peru, the best preserved region of the Amazon Basin. The lodge was several hours by boat upriver through nearly unbroken rainforest from the nearest town. For the last hour of the trip there were no visible signs of humanity and the wildlife possibilities seemed unlimited.</p>

 

<p>In my first day afield there I walked the five kilometer trail through the rainforest out to Cocacocha, the reserve’s largest oxbow lagoon. On my way back to the lodge in late afternoon I found fresh Jaguar tracks superimposed on my own tracks from earlier that day. This would be where I would finally see a Jaguar!</p>

 

<p>During the next twelve seasons that I worked at the Explorer’s Inn, I regularly found tracks of the cat, and there were occasional sightings of Jaguars by others. However, despite the countless hours I spent along the forest trails of the reserve, the closest I ever came to a Jaguar was a large, still steaming hairball left by one in the middle of a trail.</p>

 

<p>From the Explorer’s Inn, in 1990 my wife Teresa and I relocated to begin working at Manu Lodge along the Rio Manu in Manu National Park, deep, deep in the rainforest of Madre de Dios. This was serious Jaguar country, an area renowned for its Jaguars, and I figured that here my bad luck with the species would finally break - but it didn’t. During the two seasons we were there, we commonly found fresh Jaguar tracks along the river sandbars and forest trails, once or twice we heard one calling at night near the lodge, and, frustratingly, numerous Jaguar sightings were had by others traveling by boat along the Rio Manu. Especially annoying was the fact that many of those sightings were by tourists on literally their FIRST day in the Amazon Basin. Even more annoyingly, they had no idea just how lucky they were.</p>

 

<p>Through much of the 1990’s we worked in the rainforest of northeastern Peru, along the Rio Napo, one of the Amazon’s major tributaries. We were living deep in primary rainforest, but this region had long since had most of its large creatures eliminated by hunting, and I did not hold out much hope of seeing my first Jaguar there.</p>

 

<p>In 2000 my wife Teresa and I began working back in southeastern Peru, at Manu Wildlife Center along the Rio Madre de Dios - Jaguar country again. One day we were leading around a group of birding friends. Most of us climbed up the spiral staircase to a canopy platform high in the crown of a large Ceiba, but two of the group had a problem with heights, and stayed on the ground. They only went a short distance from the Ceiba, and when we came down from the treetops, they told us that a Jaguar had come out on the trail right in front of them. I almost cried. During the rest of our time at Manu Wildlife Center we saw plenty of fresh Jaguar tracks, some very close to the bungalows, but never saw a live animal.</p>

 

<p>It was not until May 2007, on the last birding trip that I led to Peru, 35 years since my first trip to South America and 31 years since first stepping into the Amazon rainforest, that the jinx was finally broken and I saw my first Jaguar. At first it looked like my bad luck would hold. During our time with the group in the Amazon lowlands of the Manu and Madre de Dios rivers, we kept crossing with other natural history guides and their groups. Every time we met up with one of them, the guide would recount a Jaguar sighting they had the day before. One such guide had seen four Jaguars with her group during the same days we were in the area. It really wasn’t fair. Then, at long last, the Jaguar god smiled upon us.</p>

 

<p>We were traveling by boat along the Rio Madre de Dios late one afternoon, returning to our lodge after a visit to one of the cochas or oxbow lagoons, when the boat driver suddenly yelled, “JAGUAR!” A beautiful, young male Jaguar was walking along the edge of a gravel bar in the river. As we approached, he turned away from the water, walked to the edge of the dense caña brava (wild cane) bordering the gravel bar, and laid down in plain view. We were able to pull the boat over to the shore, where we collectively took about 10,000 photos of the magnificent creature before it stood up and disappeared into the cane. After 31 years of working in the Peruvian rainforest, representing thousands of hours spent along forest trails and in boats plying jungle rivers, plus many months spent in the lowland rainforest of other countries like Suriname, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Belize, and Panama, all also home to Jaguars, I can say without exaggeration that this Jaguar sighting was one of the high points of my life.</p>

 

<p>With that first Jaguar sighting, the spell was broken, and since then my luck with the elusive creature has improved tremendously. In Peru, where I used to do the majority of my tropical fieldwork, Jaguars are primarily creatures of the Amazon Basin and lower slopes of the Andes. While there are plenty of them there, at least in southeastern Peru, they are very difficult to observe in their dense rainforest and cloud forest habitat. But the Pantanal, especially the Rio Cuiabá area, is another matter. Within a few weeks of seeing my first Jaguar along the Rio Madre de Dios in Peru, I was watching my second Jaguar along the Rio Tres Irmãos in the northern Pantanal. The Jaguar was Paris, an adult female. It was the first of hundreds of sightings I would have along the rivers in that region, and I suppose it was the beginning of my collaboration on this project.</p>
