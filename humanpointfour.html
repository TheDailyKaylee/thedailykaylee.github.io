Lancaster is a spine tingling story about Kyle Straker, a fifteen year old boy who witnessed what happened when technology took a wrong turn. </p>

<p>The story begins when Kyle's friend, Danny, stepped up to be an amateur hypnotizer at the local talent show.

The book itself is a light, interesting read (no more than 240 pages!) yet is intertwined with deep concepts of what it means to be human. </p>
