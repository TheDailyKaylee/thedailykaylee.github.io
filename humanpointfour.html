	<p>What if science has been implemented without humanity? What if the lives that we are living are illusions, full of deception? What if everything we think we know is a lie? Human.4 by Mike A. Lancaster is a spine tingling story about Kyle Straker, a fifteen year old boy who witnessed what happened when technology took a wrong turn. </p>

<p>The story begins when Kyle's friend, Danny, stepped up to be an amateur hypnotizer at the local talent show. Kyle and a couple of people from his town volunteered to be part of the act-- without realizing that this would change their lives forever. Once they woke up from their hypnotic state, they found the rest of the people in their town frozen in time. Technology stopped working, and tablets flashed strange symbols that fluctuated across the screens. After they explored the deserted town, they found out that things were going back to normal. Almost.</p> 

<p>The second I read the first page, I was captivated. You should read this book not only because of its intriguing plot line, but also for its complex characters and morals. The book itself is a light, interesting read (no more than 240 pages!) yet is intertwined with deep concepts of what it means to be human. </p>
