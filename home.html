  	<h1>Home - Mystic Creatures/RolePlay</h1>
	<h3>Have you ever wanted to fly, have a pet dragon, or explore those magical worlds that existed only in your imagination? Well, then, Mysticals is the place for you! With a combination of role play, pictures, and fun lands, Isle Andia (the magical world here) is better than any other game you ever played. This website is the guide to roleplay and neverending fun, so be sure to check out the content before you start your Quest. To start roleplaying, go to DIY.org, create an account, and find me at @Tarragon. Hope you enjoy! ~TheNovelEnchantress </h3>

	<h3> Writing is the source of creativity-- in it, you can describe a color that is not visible to the human eye, a distinct emotion, or an impossible situation clearer than reality itself. Writing lets you do the thinking, imagine the story, while art just puts it there in front of you. Words put together in the right way are... a beauty beyond Mona Lisa. The magic that goes into writing is so breathtaking, so alive it is hard to keep yourself in reality. Art is limited, but writing is not. ~ The Sorceress, Magic </h3>

	<h3> You hate writing? *Snarls* I'll teach you how to LOVE IT ~ Erebus </h3> 
	<h3> Writing is not putting words down on paper. We can all do that. Merely, writing is painting a picture-- with words and your imagination. </h3>
