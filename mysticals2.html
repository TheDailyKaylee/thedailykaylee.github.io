 <h1>Welcome to Lyrae, </h1>
  <p>the city of living music! This urban centre has some very friendly people and creatures, though some things you have to watch out for. </p>
<br>
<p>• Beware of the Drawa Hunters, people who work for Lyddia and enslave mythical creatures. Though they have broken the law, many government officials have beeen bribed and do not go after them. They will also likely try to kill all those who try to rescue or warn others of Lyddia's wrath. </p>
 <p>• Also, stay off the Common Road, where Drawa Hunters can easily find and capture you. Make sure that you hide your MCRC Mythical Creatures Rescue Committee badge, as some people go against our beliefs and will turn you in. </p>
