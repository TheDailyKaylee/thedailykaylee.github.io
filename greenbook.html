	<center><h1>Green Book directed by Peter Farrelly</h1></center>

	<p>Have you ever watched a movie that's both funny, deep, and uplifting? I can assure you that Green Book, which won the Academy Awards of 2018 for Best Picture, has all of these characteristics. It is now one of my favorite films I have watched this year.</p>
	<p>The story begins by introducing Tony Vallelonga (otherwise known as Tony Lip, played by Viggo Mortensen), an informal and outgoing Italian man who loves to eat. At first, he may seem nothing but likable. He gets into fights and sometimes steals or tricks others to get his own way. Tony and some of his family members are even prejudiced against blacks.</p>
	<p>After the place where he worked at went under renovation, he searches for a job to support his family. He soon comes to apply for a position as a driver for Don Shirley for several weeks. Don Shirley (or Doc, played by Mahershala Ali) is a lonely, rich African American musician who plans to go to the Deep South to play the piano in front of others. Keep in mind that this is 1962 when many parts of the South are still segregated (although it is illegal). Racism and extreme violence are imminent. So, why does Doc want to go to the place in which his life would be placed at risk? Well, he wants to expose people who are still convinced of black inferiority to the fact that others of different races can be talented too.</p> 
	<p>So, Tony Vallelonga is hired not just as a driver, but also as a personal bodyguard to protect Doc Shirley from being hurt. In the beginning, though, things don't go smoothly. Tony's informality does not sit well with the Doc and Doc's edgy, almost condescending behavior makes time pass in awkward silence. </p>
	<p>However, you'll be pleased to discover that they learn to get along despite differences. Part of the comedy is shown in the scenes when Doc learns more about pop culture via music and different foods-- including KFC from Tony or Tony learns more about formality from Doc. </p>
	<p>Will the violence in the South be too much to manage? Will their unusual friendship collapse? Will they even make it out alive? Watch this hearty and inspiring film to find out. </p>
