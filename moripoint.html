<center><h1>Mori Point </h1><center>

<p>The salty wind wraps me in its arms</p>
<p>Making my nose an icicle </p>
<p>And my lips the cerulean sky</p>
<p>Every so often speckled </p>
<p>with clusters of chapped skin </p>

<p>I grin, </p>
<p>welcoming the cold with open arms </p>
<p>Breathing in the briny air </p>
<p>And dig my toes into the </p>
<p>Warm, obsidian black sands</p>
<p>Sliding down hills </p>
<p>And plummeting into the beach</p>

<p>My friend and I jump into the inky grains</p>
<p>Make sand angels</p>
<p>And search for treasure:</p>
<p>shells, </p>
<p>driftwood, </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>pebbles</p>
 <p>That have been rounded by the waves</p>
<p>For unknowable years</p>
<p>Only to have been washed ashore</p>
<p>And stuffed into the pockets of </p>
<p>Pirates</p>

<p>After collecting our riches, </p>
<p>We decide to climb the pink and green</p>
<p>majestic mountain </p>
<p>Above the beach</p>
<p>And search for little critters</p>
<p>Our eyes light up as we find </p>
<p>a tiger moth caterpillar</p>
<p>Awaiting us on a leaf </p>
<p>Orange, black, and white</p>
<p>Its pricks look like feathers</p>
<p>We giggle as it climbs onto our hand</p>
<p>And squirms around, tickling our palm </p>

<p>Next, we stumble upon a </p>
<p>California Red-legged Frog</p>
<p>And marvel at its ruby and brown skin </p>
<p>Dotted with black spots</p>
<p>Like a ripe strawberry</p>
<p>It's the primary snack</p>
 <p>for the endangered </p>
<p>San Francisco garter snake</p>
<p>It glitters in the sunlight</p>
<p>A plump garnet </p>

<p>Finally, tired, we sit down on</p>
 <p>the craggy rocks of the mountain</p>
<p>And watch the sea roll</p>
<p>Back and forth</p>
<p>Back and forth</p>
<p>The waves ombre:</p>
<p>From sapphire to indigo </p>

<p>Seagulls dot the horizon</p>
<p>The sun begins to sink</p>
<p>Its last rays of warmth </p>
<p>Casting the clouds </p>
<p>orange, pink, red, and purple</p>
<p>In candy colors</p>

<p>A peregrine falcon calls in the distance</p>
<p>With our telescope, we zoom in </p>
<p>She's standing regally on the cliff</p>
<p>Feathers ruffled, eyes like hard cut gems</p>
<p>Looking for prey</p>
<p>Surely empyrean</p>

<p>As the falcon takes off and disappears</p>
<p>We continue to watch the sea</p>
<p>Killdeer plovers rush in and out of the waves</p>
<p>As if taunting it to come to get them</p>
<p>Yet it never does</p>

<p>Killdeer</p>
<p>The last of the birds I shall see today</p>
<p>It makes me laugh that it has such </p>
<p>An ironic name</p>
<p>For it never hurts anyone </p>

<p>Suddenly</p>
<p>A crash</p>
<p>I gasp</p>
<p>Something breaks the surface for</p>
<p>One second </p>
<p>A huge tail is launched into the air</p>
<p>Its color like storm clouds</p>
<p>And the depths of the Pacific</p>
<p>Splash</p>
<p>It's gone</p>
<p>Silence</p>
<p>We look at each other, then smile and sit back</p>
<p>Listening to the waves</p>
<p>And thinking of all the things</p>
<p>We did and saw. </p>
