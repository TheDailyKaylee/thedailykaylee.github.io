<b>The Trustworthiness of North Korea</b>
<p>Is North Korea really trustworthy? The peace talks seem to be going extremely well, but we must be skeptical. In 2000, 2007, and 2012, North Korea and South Korea agreed on signing peace treaties yet North Korea never followed through with it. The North had promised no missile testing yet continued to fire them off-- labeling them as mere "satellites". How do we know if we can trust them if they have repeatedly made these dishonest decisions before? </p>

<p>Now, North Korea is demanding that America should lift its sanctions because it is following through with denuclearization. However, a UN report showed that North Korea hasn't stopped its facilities but actually has continued its nuclear program as predicted. To try to get around the sanctions, North Korea is illegally trading with other countries (importing oil and fossil fuels). I, as the secretary of state, believe that we need to keep strict watch of North Korea's decisions and make sure that they are not continuing their missile program. </p>

<b>The Intentions of the North Korean President</b>
<p>What does Kim Jong Un, the North Korean President, really want? Power, foreign aid, and trade. How will he get those things? When Kim needed foreign aid in the past (to get supplies for his country), he continued to build up his nuclear weapons. Why nuclear weapons? Nuclear weapons are an excellent negotiation tool (if you had missiles that were capable of reaching another country, you would be feared and taken more seriously). Additionally, Kim made unpredictable statements that made other world leaders frightened of his potential nuclear threat. He was also deemed crazy for doing so. America and other countries, fearing war, got very anxious and tried to stop the continuation of North Korea's nuclear arsenal. In response, North Korea struck a deal to denuclearize in return for lifting sanctions and getting the goods they needed. America, relieved, didn't realize that they were getting tricked and North Korea actually wasn't stopping their progression in nuclear missile trajectory. This theory, formed by Andrei Lankov, a scholar, is a manipulative cycle, and America and other countries are making the same mistakes over and over again. We must prevent this from happening another time. If North Korea continues to betray us by testing their missiles, we should put more sanctions on them until they give in.</p> 

<b>Alternative Ways to Negotiate With Iran </b>
	<p>The situation with Iran is similar to the situation in North Korea. Both countries have very low economies, are burdened with many sanctions, are known for violence or terrorism, and have been hiding their nuclear weapon progression. However, Trump's strategy of using sanctions to reduce trade and bring the economy down doesn't seem to be working in Iran as effectively as in North Korea. Already, President Trump has backed out of the Iran Nuclear Deal; which aimed to denuclearize Iran, because he found too many faults in it. For one, it didn't include other types of missiles and the fact that some people in Iran are funding terrorists in Syria. He takes on a more aggressive role which makes a devastating impact on Iran's already low economy. "I cannot trust a president who walks away from international agreements on a whim, one who prefers bullying adversaries over building trust," the president of Iran stated. I believe that instead of using violence or bullying to persuade the country to denuclearize, we should instead use negotiations to help build a stable relationship. In turn for them denuclearizing and stepping out of the war in Syria, we would give them more technology and infrastructure to help boost their economy. This would create more jobs other than in the fossil fuel industry (which caused mass pollution in Iran) and help the poor people there find new opportunities. By introducing capitalism and a new form of government to Iran, I believe that it would be more successful and less corrupted. Additionally, I believe that America should also reduce its nuclear program and focus more on education or humanitarian efforts. In this way, we can help the world denuclearize by giving them the necessities they need in return for them dismantling their nuclear weapons.</p> 

<b>Alternative Ways to Negotiate With Korea</b>
<p>• Giving food/resources so people won't starve</p>
<p>• Developing more technology and infrastructure</p>
<p>• Helping the healthcare industry there</p>
<p>• Introducing more capitalism</p>

<p>As I said before, we can help the world denuclearize by giving them the necessities they need in return for them dismantling their nuclear weapons. What does Korea need? Food, technology, infrastructure, and a good healthcare industry. In return for Kim Jong Un letting the US witness the entire dismantling of their nukes, we will give these greatly needed items to them. In the same way as we helped Japan rebuild after WW11, we can help North Korea become a more democratic nation by gradually introducing them to a different way of life.</p> 

<b>Why We Should Find Alternative Ways Other Than To Sanction Or To Put More Troops to Persuade the North </b>
	<p>The two things that North Korea do not want are more sanctions and more troops to threaten them in South Korea. If we keep threatening them instead of negotiating, we will get on bitter terms with the President. Even though pressure may sound like a good idea, more sanctions and troops are something that will convince North Korea NOT to work with us. We do not want to make more enemies. I suggest that America should become a role model for other nations to follow-- instead of a bullying superpower we could become a country who lends a helping hand to those most in need. </p>
